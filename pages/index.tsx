            <p>
            Web-based system for dissemination of flood forecasts was operationalized by CWC in 2014 with information being made available on near real time basis (Ref: https://ffs.tamcnhp.com/). In addition to this, CWC has partnered with Google to disseminate the flood warning through its Public Alert platform. An additional channel to reach out to the end beneficiaries is through deployment of real time messaging service of flood forecasts soon after their generation with opt-in option for end users as well as provision for blanket area specific messaging in affected areas. End beneficiaries can in turn help in crowd sourcing of information related to inundation with geo tagged as well as time stamped images and information related to water levels. Such crowd sourced data can help in ground truthing of inundation for known events of floods which will enable in future endeavours of generation of flood inundation forecasts and flood plain zonation.
